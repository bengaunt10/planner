# CalmDay

This project follows the development of a task management full stack web application aiming to streamline the organisation of a daily schedule while maintaining wellbeing and productivity. An intuitive, accessible and simple interface is implemented to allow users to manage their tasks effectively and address the issue of cognitive overload in the context of task management. Django was implemented in the backend and React in the frontend; therefore, the core functionality was implemented through Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Authentication, wellbeing tools, task creation and automatic task scheduling are some of the features presented by this system. Aimed for all users, targeted at students and a focus on being accessible for those neurodivergent.
